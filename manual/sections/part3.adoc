== PART III. FUNCTIONS OF WIS

*3.1 LIST OF WIS FUNCTIONS*

3.1.1 WIS centres collectively support the major functions listed below:

(a) Collect, share, and archive data;

(b) Compile and manage datasets;

(c) Create discovery metadata;

(d) Manage access to data and services;

(e) Maintain and expose a catalogue of data and services;

(f) Monitor data availability, and

(g) Manage system performance.

[.small]
Note: Access to data and services may be restricted in order to implement data policies and protect the integrity of WIS.

*3.2 FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE OF WIS*

3.2.1 There are three main perspectives when considering the function of WIS:

(a) Data provision;

(b) Data consumption;

(c) Global coordination.

3.2.2 A data publisher (NC or DCPC) provides access to a dataset (for example, by publishing data files to a web server or hosting an interactive web service/API). A dataset may consist of one or more files, objects, or database records. Access to a dataset may be restricted in accordance with the data policy specified by the data owner.

3.2.3 A data publisher manages the quality of the datasets it provides to ensure that the data meet the expectations of the data consumers.

3.2.4 A data publisher maintains discovery metadata about the datasets it provides. Each dataset is described by a discovery metadata record providing sufficient information for data consumers to determine whether the dataset meets their needs, where the dataset originated, how they might access the data, and whether there are any restrictions on its use. The discovery metadata record also identifies the points of contact.

3.2.5 A data publisher provides notifications about updates to the datasets it provides and the associated discovery metadata – including notification that a dataset is no longer available in WIS. For example, a data publisher would provide a notification to inform users of the availability of a new observation in a SYNOP dataset, of the availability of a new numerical weather prediction (NWP) model run, and so forth.

3.2.6 The components used by data publishers to provide data and associated discovery metadata are collectively referred to as a “WIS node”.

3.2.7 A Global Broker distributes notifications from data publishers, providing data consumers with highly available access to notifications and other WIS infrastructure components. Multiple Global Broker instances are needed for the effective operation of WIS.

3.2.8 A Global Cache copies, stores, and provides highly available access to discovery metadata records and core data for real-time or near-real-time exchange. Multiple Global Cache instances are needed for the effective operation of WIS. Data are available from a Global Cache for a duration compatible with the real-time or near-real-time schedule of the data and not less than 24 hours.

[.small]
Note: Core data is defined in Resolution 1 (Cg-Ext(2021)).

3.2.9 A Global Discovery Catalogue copies and stores discovery metadata records from all data publishers and enables data consumers to browse or search for data that meet their needs. A single Global Discovery Catalogue instance is sufficient for the effective operation of WIS, but there may be multiple instances.

3.2.10 Search engines may index discovery metadata records provided to a Global Discovery Catalogue.

3.2.11 Data consumers find data that meet their needs using either a Global Discovery Catalogue or search engines. The discovery metadata for a dataset indicate how to access the data and/or how to subscribe to notifications about the dataset.

3.2.12 Data consumers may subscribe, via Global Brokers, to notifications about datasets and metadata. Upon receipt of a notification, a data consumer determines what action to take, for example, to download the new data identified in the notification.

3.2.13 Data consumers may access data from Global Caches or directly from a WIS node. Data consumers should access real-time and near-real-time core data via Global Caches.

3.2.14 Global Service components (Global Broker, Global Cache, and Global Discovery Catalogue) provide metrics about system performance and data availability. WIS nodes may also provide such metrics. Global Monitors collect these metrics and provide a view of current WIS performance and historical trends.

3.2.15 GISCs ensure the effective operation of WIS. Collectively, GISCs ensure that WIS meets the needs of all WMO programmes, activity areas, and regional associations – including optimizing the distribution of Global Service components, managing threats to the performance of WIS, and responding to incidents to restore system performance. Individually, a GISC supports data publishers and data consumers in its AoR, driving the adoption of good practices and resolving data sharing problems.
